# nutrilog
### Overview 
#### Nutrition tracker application using MongoDB / Express.js / Node.js / React.js

* This app utilizes the FoodData Central API to provide users with accurate and up-to-date nutritional information for thousands of foods. This API allows my app to access the USDA's comprehensive food database, which includes detailed nutrient profiles for a wide range of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and meats. With this data, my app can provide users with a detailed breakdown of the macronutrients, micronutrients, and calorie content of the foods they consume, as well as information on any allergens or dietary restrictions. By leveraging the power of the FoodData Central API, my app can deliver personalized and accurate nutrition information to help users make informed decisions about their dietary habits and achieve their health goals.

### Key Features
* Architected an intuitive single page app with React and implemented responsive design with React-Bootstrap for a consistent user experience across screen sizes.
* Developed back-end with Express and MongoDB for their flexible structure and ease of data access.
* Implemented a user login and registration using back-end validation, Cookies, and JSON Web Token for secure user experience.
* Created RESTful API in order to allow user CRUD operations.
* Integrated the USDA FoodData Central API to incorporate nutrition data.
